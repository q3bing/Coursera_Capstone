Walking down the streets in New York, aside from the fast-paced pedestrians and action film level skilled yellow cabs, Starbucks is probably the most often seen object. As the largest coffee chain in the United States, it isn't only famous for its controversially delicious drinks, but as well for its stores location strategy. The question of "why does Starbucks choose a certain location" is a common business problem for it provides valuable insight into location selection strategy for its competitors as well as entrepreneurs seeking to open a store within even remotely related industry.

This project aims to dig into the location selection of Starbucks, from a micro perspective, using Manhattan as research soil. To be more specific, we study all Starbucks locations in Manhattan and try to figure out the similarities among these locations based on the venues within those locations' proximity. We will use Foursquare API to retrieve location data, define a "Starbucks proximity score" for a given location, and implement machine learning techniques to score any given location. The score provides guidance for new Starbucks store location selection, but more importantly, for individual investors to open similar stores, for example, a fast food store or a tea house.
