We will use primarily Foursquare location data for the project.

For starters, we retrieve all Starbucks locations in Manhattan using the search query in Foursquare;
Second, we generate a large number of location points within Manhattan;
Third, retrieve venue data within a certain radius of each location point using the explore query in Foursquare. Each location point will be an observation of the data to be used.

After above steps, we finish the necessary steps to assemble data necessary for our following analyses.
